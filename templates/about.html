            Faizaâ€™s first encounter with garment making took place during her early years while spending time with her grandmother who was a seamstress herself, and who taught her the basics of knighting and sewing. Her passion led her to take numerous internships in tailor shops while studying English literature in university. Through these internships she learned the basics of pattern making and developed an understanding for fabric characteristics.
